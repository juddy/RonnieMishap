This is all original composition by me under the name "Ronnie Mishap". Performed on a junk 6-string acoustic with ~4 strings.

Various preparations and techniques were employed to the guitar itself, as well as signal processing and tape manipulation.

Some of the effects can be found in an accompanying repository.
